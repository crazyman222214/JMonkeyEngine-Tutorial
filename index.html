            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                JMonkeyEngine is a modern game engine written primarily written in Java. This is a very useful library with a very "code first" approach.
                In this tutorial, I will primarily be working within Intellij to showcase how this engine isn't tied to any SDK or IDE.
                However, the online documentation is rather sloppy for nieche problems or describing the functionality of a certain class.
            </p>
            <p>
                They have a <em>rather mediocre</em> sdk they have programmed with this game engine in mind with further documentation found within the inside code.
                That can be found <a href="https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/sdk" target="_blank">here</a>. <br/> Otherwise, you can find more information about JMonkeyEngine and start a project <a href="https://jmonkeyengine.org" target="_blank">here</a>. 
                <img src="./images/GetStartedButton.png">
                Press this button on the website to start a project.
                Input the information for the project and press download a starter project. It is going to download a .zip file with a Java Project inside.
            </p>
            <p>
                This tutorial will not be a tutorial about anything specific, rather I will just demonstrate how to use the most critical parts of the engine.<br/>
                I will inevitably use assets from my 3d chess project, which were made in a 3d modeler such as Blender, but this <strong>will not</strong> be a tutorial for 3d modeling <em>yet</em>.

            <p>
                Now that you have a starter project, you can open and run the project.
                The directory is
                <br/>-PROJECT_NAME-/src/main/java/-PACKAGE_NAME-/-PROJECT_NAME-
            </p>
            <img src="./images/FileDirectory.png" />
            <p>
                If you run the program just as it is, you should get a window that looks like this
            </p>
            <img src="./images/FirstRun.png">
            <p>
                That blue box is the one created by the initial <code>simpleInitApp()</code>
                The controls to use the camera are:
                <div class="container">
                    <ul>
                        <li>WASD to move</li>
                        <li> Q and Z to do up and down the Y-Axis</li>
                        <li>the mouse to look around</li>
                        <li>and ESC to close the program.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </p>
            <h3 id="OverridenMethods">Overriden Methods</h3>
            <p>
                Going back to the code, there are a few things of note.<br/>
                The <code>Main</code> method contains 3 lines of <strong>important</strong> code.
                <br/><code>Test app = new Test();</code> creates an instance of this class since <code>Main()</code> is static.
                <br><code>app.showSettings(false);</code> set this to true and see the settings.
                <br/><code>app.start();</code> starts the application.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/MainMethod.png" />
            <p>
                If you'll notice, there is also one other method with a body. The <code>simpleInitApp()</code> method is an overrided method from the parent class, <code>SimpleApplication</code>.
                It runs as soon as the app is ran inside the Main Method.
                <br/><code>Box b = new Box(1,1,1);</code> is creating a Box Shape, passing the dimensions through the constructor.
                <br/><code>Geometry geom = new Geometry("Box", b);</code> is creating a Geometry for the RootNode, passing through a String name of the shape and the variable we created previous, b.
                <br/><code>Material mat = new Material(assetManager, "Common/MatDefs/Misc/Unshaded.j3md");</code> is defining the material, which is what the user actually sees, is defined using the <code>assetManager</code>, which is a variable inside our <code>SimpleApplication</code> and with the path of a unshaded texture.
                <br/><code>mat.setColor("Color", ColorRGBA.Blue);</code> is just setting the color of the material.
                <br/><code>geom.setMaterial(mat);</code> is setting the material of the geometry to the material we defined up above, <code>mat</code>.
                <br/><code>rootNode.attachChild(geom);</code> is attaching the geometry to the <code>rootNode</code>, a variable inside <code>SimpleApplication</code>
            </p>

            <img src="./images/SimpleInitApp.png" width="90%" />
            <p>The other two methods are part of the abstract methods, but will not be touched on right now.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="SimpleApplicationSection">
            <h2>SimpleApplication</h2>
            <hr/>
            <h3 id="UnderstandingTheSimpleApplication">Understanding the <em>Simple</em> Application</h3>
            <p>
                To truly learn how to operate the concrete class, it is important to delve into the abstract class to truly learn how to utilize the concrete class.
                <br/> If you press Shift and click on SimpleApplication, it will bring you into the class. <br />
            </p>
            <img src="./images/SimpleApplication.png"/>
            <p>
                The first thing I would like to point out is at the bottom is the methods you inherit in your <code>Main</code> class.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/InheritedMethods.png" />

            <p>
                Another thing that would help in learning this library is to become familiar with what getters and setters are available to you. <br/>
                There are certain situations you may end up needing to get the <code>FlyCam</code>, which is your camera.<br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                The next thing that I would like to point out is the constructor of the class. By default, it makes new instances of:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>StatsAppState</code></li>
                    <li><code>FlyCamAppState</code></li>
                    <li><code>AudioListenerState</code></li>
                    <li><code>DebugKeysAppState</code></li>
                    <li><code>ConstantVerifierState</code></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                This tutorial will be utilizing various methods/variables from these, but it isn't fully necessary to delve into the classes individually.<br />
                Just know they exist and when they get referenced in here, I will explain how it works.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/Constructor.png" />

            <h3 id="Inilitialize">Inilitialize</h3>
            <p>
                I am seperating this into it's own section purely because it is a big method and most of it is pretty important to understand as well. <br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                For the most part, this method is to create different variable and assign them. 
                <ol>
                    <li>The first notable part is assigning a <code>flyCam</code>, then assigns the state in the <code>stateManager</code>.</li>
                    <li>The next part adds the mapping to have ESC key close the program and F5 to Hide/Show the stats on the window.</li>
                    <li>After that, it calls the <code>simpleInitApp()</code>.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Meaning that as soon as the <code>Main</code> method is called, you need to have the first line make a new instance of the concrete class.</strong><br />
                As soon as the <code>Main</code> class runs, your <code>SimpleInitApp()</code> code will run <strong>before</strong> anything else in the <code>Main</code> method.<br/>
                This can be used to do things prior to when the user can see the pop-up window, but it also needs to be used precisely to avoid bugs.

            <hr/>
            <h3 id="UsingTheFlyByCamera">Using the FlyByCamera</h3>
            <p>
                The <code>flyCam</code> variable is a public variable given to us through the parent class. This is the camera that the player can control.<br />
                To disable the camera, and disable the player being able to move it, you can use <code>flyCam.setEnabled(false);</code>
            </p>
            <img src="./images/setEnabled(false).png" />
            <p>
                While it may look the same, the user cannot interact with the camera.
            </p>
            <h3 id="MovingTheCamera">Moving The Camera</h3>
            <p>
                Because of how they have the encapsulation, we must interact with the position of the camera using <code>flyCam.onAnalog();</code><br/>
                This method takes in 3 parameters:
                <ol>
                    <li>String: Name</li>
                    <li>int: length</li>
                    <li>int: duration</li>
                </ol>
                <br/>
                The name parameter has a certain convention that they use. If you Shift + Click on the <code>onAnalog()</code> method, you can find the String Variables.<br />
                To find the string representation, you can Shift + Click on the CameraInput class to look at all of them.
            </p>
            <img src="./images/CameraInput.png"/>
            <p>
                Meaning that if I were to write the line <code>flyCam.onAnalog("FLYCAM_StrafeRight", 2, 200);</code> I would get something that looks like this:
            </p>
            <img src="./images/onAnalog(Right).png" />
            <h3 id="HavingFunWithSimpleUpdate">Having fun with simpleUpdate()</h3>
            <p>
                One of the defaulted methods within the <code>Main</code> class is the <code>simpleUpdate(float tpf)</code> method. <br/>
                The one parameter stands for Time Per Frame, which is the &Delta; (Delta) of time between each Frame. <br />
                We can utilize this part of the code to make it so that we move the camera every frame, effectively making an "Animation". <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                I would personally seperate the function call into a method, so that we can single out all camera movement into one method. <br />
                Also, would recommend that you make the length of the camera movement <strong>WAY</strong> shorter so you can actually witness the animation.
            </p>

            <h3>Adding Custom Assets</h3>
            <p>
                When I used this engine, It was to create a 3d chess game. So we needed to actually insert the assets into the engine.<br />
                To do this, we are going to need a .glb file type. In blender, you can export it to such a file.<br/>
